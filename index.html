                    <p class="description">The lone 14er in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, Long's Peak is one 
                        of the state's most popular hiking spots. After it's first ascent in 1868 by John Wesley Powell,
                        15,000 hikers and climbers attempt to summit it each year. About half will see the views from the top.
                        Partly due to its traffic and partly due to its difficulty it has earned the dubious reputation of
                        "Colorado's Deadliest Mountain".</p>

                    <p class="routes">By far the most popular route to climb this beast is via the "Keyhole Route". This route brings 
                        it's victims up a deceptively easy 7.4 mile hike to the Boulderfields, a barren wasteland of boulders
                        sitting just below the summit. This is a popular spot for overnight campers. After the Boulderfields climbers
                        will traverse through the route's iconic keyhole and along narrow exposed routes, ending in a 300 foot Class 3 scramble
                        to the summit.</p>

                    <p class="difficulty">This hike is not for the faint of heart. Hikers die summiting Long's Peak each
                        year. If you plan to attempt it, be prepared for a lot of exposure and technical hiking, potentially
                        requiring crampons and some serious climbing skills. </p>

                    <p class="description">Sitting in the Mosquito Range of the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Democrat is a common
                        beginner's peak for those just starting their journey into Colorado high alpine climbing. Sitting 
                        just west of Breckenridge near the town of Alma, the peak provides easy access for climbers across
                        the state.</p>
                    
                    <p class="routes">Many climbers will choose to tackle this peak via the Kite Lake Trailhead. Be sure
                        to get started early as the parking lot will fill up quick, especially on holiday weekends. Those 
                        looking for an extra challenge can tackle the DeCaLiBro, a route which summits Mt. Democrat, Mt. 
                        Cameron, Mt. Lincoln, and Mt. Bross all in a single trip.</p>

                    <p class="difficulty">While this mountain itself is relatively easy, it is still a 14er. Hikers should
                        be prepared for a low oxygen environment and as always, be wary of rapidly changing weather conditions
                        on the mountain.</p>
